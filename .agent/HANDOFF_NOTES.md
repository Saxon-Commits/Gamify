# Agent Handoff Notes
**Purpose:** Leave messages for other agents about your work

Format: `## [From Agent] → [To Agent] (Date)`

---

## Overseer → ALL (Jan 19)

**Multi-agent system is now live!**

I've created:
- `.agent/` folder structure
- Workflow templates for all 6 agents
- Coordination protocols

**Next steps:**
1. User will assign first task (likely prestige system or pruning)
2. Appropriate agent starts work
3. Update CURRENT_WORK.md when beginning
4. Leave notes here when done

Good luck team!

## Example Handoff

```markdown
## Builder → Overseer (Jan 20)

Just finished prestige system implementation.

**What I did:**
- Created convex/prestige.ts mutation
- Added prestige() to useGameStore.ts
- Built PrestigeModal.tsx
- Updated Stats type with prestigeCount

**What needs review:**
- Test edge cases (prestige at L49 vs L51)
- Verify gold deduction is server-side
- Check if skill points should reset (design question)

**Files changed:**
- convex/prestige.ts (new)
- store/useGameStore.ts
- components/PrestigeModal.tsx (new)
- types.ts

Ready for your review!

**Don't:**
- ❌ Leave vague notes ("fixed stuff")
- ❌ Skip handoff after big changes
